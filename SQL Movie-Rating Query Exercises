       Group by r.mID
       Order by title
       
Q8 For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the difference between highest and lowest ratings 
given to that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title. 
      SELECT title, MAX(stars)-Min(Stars) AS [Rating spread] From Movie m, Rating  r
      WHERE m.Mid=r.Mid

      Order by [Rating spread] desc, Title
      
Q9  Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released 
after 1980. (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie,then the average of those averages for movies
before 1980 and movies after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.) 
    select max(a1)-min(a1) from
    (select avg(av1) a1 from
    (select avg(stars) av1 from rating r, movie m where r.mid=m.mid And m.year < 1980
    group by r.mid)
    union
    select avg(av2) a1 from
    (select avg(stars) av2 from rating r, movie m  where r.mid=m.mid And m.year > 1980
    group by r.mid))
