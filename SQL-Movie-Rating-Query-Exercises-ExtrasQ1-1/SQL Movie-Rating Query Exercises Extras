Q1  Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind. 
     SELECT distinct NAME FROM Reviewer R, rating rr, movie m
     WHERE r.rID=rr.rID and rr.mID=m.mID and m.title ="Gone with the Wind"
     
Q2  For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the movie, 
return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars. 
     SELECT r.Name, m.title,stars FROM Reviewer R, rating rr, movie m
     WHERE m.director =r.name and r.rID=rr.rID And m.mID=RR.mID

Q3  (1 point possible)
Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, alphabetized. 
(Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word in the title is fine; 
no need for special processing on last names or removing "The".) 
      SELECT distinct r1.Name
     FROM Reviewer R1, rating rr1, Reviewer R2, rating rr2, Movie AS M
     WHERE rr1.Mid=rr2.Mid And ( r1.rID=rr1.rID or r2.rID=rr2.rID) 
     Union
     SELECT distinct m.title
     FROM Movie AS M
     Order by r1.name, m.title
